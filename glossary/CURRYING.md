# Currying

Currying is the technique of translating the evaluation of a function that takes N arguments into evaluating a sequence of N functions, each with a single argument.

This process is done by calling the function with one parameter, and return a new function with the parameter already bound inside a [closure](CLOSURE.md).

For example, letâ€™s say we have an `add` function that takes two parameters `a` and `b`:

```js
// The native function definition would be to have a and b as parameters:
add(3, 5)

// After currying the function, we can then apply it like so:
curryAdd(3)(5)
```

This is an interesting technique allowing to *partially call* a function, leaving the rest of the call for later.

For instance, with our previous `curryAdd` function:

```js
var add3 = curryAdd(3);
var add10 = curryAdd(10);

// Then we can call
add3(5) // => 8
add10(5) // => 15
```


[Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs#curry), [Wu](https://fitzgen.github.io/wu.js/#curryable) and [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/docs/#curry) are 3 of the many libraries that provide currying.
