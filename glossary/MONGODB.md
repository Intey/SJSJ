# MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) is a fast, reliable and performant Javascript-powered **NoSQL** database. It uses the concept of **Documents** which is a sort of [JSON](JSON.md)-like data model (called **BSON** for Binary Simple Object Model), making querying faster and easier.

The main advantage over traditional MySQL databases is the flexibility offered by the Document Model to achieve simpler and faster integration.
