# Polymer

With Google's [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org) library you can extend the vocabulary of HTML with your own custom elements (also known as Web Components) that can carry their own CSS styling and JavaScript code. Once created, these elements can be reused and composed together with other native or custom HTML elements.
